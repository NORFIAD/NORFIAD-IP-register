**Adaptive Depth Processing Architecture with Logic-Driven Iteration**

Processing architecture where computational depth is determined by content requirements rather than fixed architectural parameters. System iterates based on logical need — resolving simple inputs in a single pass while automatically extending processing for complex inputs until resolution is achieved.

Includes mechanisms for partial-match reprocessing, established-route abandonment when paths fail, and decomposition of large inputs with result reassembly.
