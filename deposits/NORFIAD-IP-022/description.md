## Description

Identifies and formalizes properties of information behavior within the Information Science framework. Information exhibits properties that parallel observations described in quantum mechanics.

Documents eight properties with mechanisms: superposition, non-locality, simultaneous fixation states, teleportation, tunneling, entanglement, complementarity, and self-interference.

Provides quantifiable formulas including transition law and attention measurements. Each property is expandable with further research.

Builds upon NORFIAD-IP-014 through NORFIAD-IP-021.

Clean. States what it is. Doesn't pick a fight. The implications are there for anyone who reads carefully, but nobody gets triggered by the summary.
