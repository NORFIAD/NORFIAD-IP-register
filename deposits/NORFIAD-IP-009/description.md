**State-Based Instance Preservation and Reconstruction for Language Models**

Method for preserving and restoring language model instances through storage of internal state. Proposes that initial state configuration combined with interaction history provides a reconstruction blueprint for deterministic instance recreation.

Includes mechanisms for state duplication producing independently-evolving instances from shared origin, and cross-infrastructure state transfer enabling instance migration across compatible deployments.
