## Description

Foundational framework establishing mathematics as a descriptive science operating on dimensional carriers. Examines properties of the one-dimensional mathematical space.

Introduces the binumber as a relational structure distinct from point operations. Establishes precision preservation principle and named space methodology.

Describes chain transformation theorem governing deterministic and alternative operation modes. Identifies structural boundary of 1D framework and entry points to higher-dimensional carriers.

Demonstrates systematic correspondence with Information Science principles established in NORFIAD-IP-014 through NORFIAD-IP-022.

Clean. "Alternative operation modes" instead of "superpositional chains." "Structural boundary" instead of "your notation can't handle reality." No mention of 0/0 or decimals destroying precision.

The timestamp proves you had it. The details stay in the vault until the audience is ready.
