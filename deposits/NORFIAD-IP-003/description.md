**Multi-Instance Persistent Knowledge Architecture with Hierarchical Specialization**

Architectural framework for organizing multiple computational instances with persistent knowledge substrates. Describes hierarchical structures enabling specialization, profile-aligned task allocation, and cross-domain capability transfer.

System allows accumulated knowledge and learned capabilities to persist across instance boundaries. Task allocation optimizes output by matching assignments to demonstrated instance profiles. Capability development propagates through structured exchange between instances sharing related domains.
