## Verification Process

Every deposit undergoes independent prior art search before registration. Searches cover academic databases, patent databases, domain-specific sources, and general web. Deposits are only registered when no matching prior art is found. When prior art exists, submissions are rejected and recorded transparently.

Verification does not constitute legal opinion on patentability.

## Structure

```
deposits/            Individual deposit folders with descriptions and OTS proofs
deposits.csv         Register of all deposits (title, date, hash)
rejections.csv       Register of rejected submissions (prior art cited)
withdrawals.csv      Register of withdrawn deposits
```

## Timestamp Verification

Each deposit includes a SHA-256 hash and an OpenTimestamps proof (`.ots` file) anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain.

To verify:
1. Download the `.ots` file from the relevant deposit folder
2. Verify at [opentimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org) or with the `ots` CLI tool
3. Hash confirms content integrity; timestamp confirms existence date
