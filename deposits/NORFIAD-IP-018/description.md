## Description

Framework for free information behaviour, completing the trilogy with NORFIAD-IP-016 and NORFIAD-IP-017.

Defines information space as distinct domain. Describes dimensional structure of unconstrained information. Addresses dimensional collapse during encoding and expansion during decoding.

Introduces abstraction as key-based mechanism dependent on shared context. Provides information density formula as quantifiable metric for information systems.

Builds upon "The Two Types of Information," "Properties of Fixed Information," and "Properties of Volatile Information."
