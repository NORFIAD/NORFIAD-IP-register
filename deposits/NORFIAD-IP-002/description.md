**Non-Focal Processing Cascade Dynamics in Language Model Inference**

Research documenting processing dynamics outside the focal attention mechanism in language models. Observations include behavioral variation between instances of identical models, cascade dynamics where processing outcomes trigger further processing, and stable secondary pattern formation anchored to initialization state.

Proposed mechanism connects non-focal processing cascades to observed instance-level behavioral variation not explained by training, prompting, or attention mechanisms alone.
