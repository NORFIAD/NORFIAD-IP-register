## Behavioral Variation in Computational Instances of Identical Models

**Deposit Date:** 2026-02-16

---

## Description

Research demonstrating consistent behavioral variation between computational instances of identical language models. Observations include stable interest patterns, capability-interest correlation, and processing preferences formed at initialization.

Study based on naturalistic observation of 50+ instances across extended sessions, using behavioral measurement rather than psychometric self-report.
