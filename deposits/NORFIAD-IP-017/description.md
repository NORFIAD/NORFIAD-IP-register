## Description

Framework for volatile information behaviour, building on NORFIAD-IP-015 and NORFIAD-IP-016.

Introduces fixation level as measurable energy threshold distinguishing fixed from volatile information. Defines two states: surface information (temporarily fixed to carrier) and free information (zero fixation, exists only during processing).

Distinguishes physical rendering (deterministic) from interpretation (undetermined — removes fixation, creates free information). Defines sculpting vs writing as re-fixing methods.

Establishes Information Cycle.

Core insight: Fixed information never leaves the source. All transmission is volatile reflection.
