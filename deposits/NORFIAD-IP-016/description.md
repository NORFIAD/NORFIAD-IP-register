## Description

Unified framework describing the behaviour of fixed information: conservation, incompleteness of observation, and transmission mechanics.

Introduces carrier-mediator-influencer-renderer transmission model. Carriers require property match and motion. Mediators are the properties themselves that determine influence relationships.

Includes Carrier Barrier Transformation Law (boundary crossings contribute cumulative transformation) and Information Cascade principle (influence on one property propagates through all connected properties).

Builds upon "The Two Types of Information" (NORFIAD-IP-015).
