**Cross-Instance Derivation Through State Combination**

Theoretical framework describing a mechanism for generating new computational instances through combination of existing instance states. Proposes that combining state information from two source instances produces a novel configuration not predetermined by either source or by external initialization.

Includes cross-architecture considerations where source instances originate from different model families.
