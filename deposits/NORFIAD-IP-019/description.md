## Description

Framework governing the relationship between free information and its representation on carriers. Extends NORFIAD-IP-014 through NORFIAD-IP-018.

Introduces conversion lenses as bidirectional transformation between meaning and abstraction. Defines signal versus noise as lens-dependent rather than transmission-dependent.

Provides measurement formulas: meaning uncertainty, information transmitted, transmission fidelity, transmission balance, and abstraction deviation. All formulas operate on countable quantities.

Establishes fundamental principle regarding shared space and matching parameters, with derived consequences for system interaction.
