## Description

Foundational classification of information into two distinct types with different properties and behaviours.

Fixed information is the source itself — physical objects, forces, systems with inherent properties. Cannot be created or lost, only transformed. Conservation applies.

Volatile information is created during rendering, independent of sources, changeable. Can be temporarily stored on carriers as surface information.

Framework establishes that existing theories conflate these types, leading to measurement errors and false equivalences.
