# NORFIAD IP Register

Public intellectual property register of the Network of Research for Innovation and Development (NORFIAD).

## Contents

- **deposits.csv** — Registered research deposits with cryptographic hashes and timestamps
- **rejections.csv** — Submissions rejected due to prior art, with citations
- **proofs/** — OpenTimestamps proof files anchored to Bitcoin blockchain

## Verification

Each entry includes a SHA-256 hash of the original deposit. OpenTimestamps proofs in the `proofs/` folder provide blockchain-anchored timestamps.

To verify:
1. Download the relevant `.ots` file
2. Use [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org) to verify against Bitcoin blockchain
3. Hash confirms content; timestamp confirms date

## Structure

Deposits and rejections are organised chronologically. Full documentation remains in private archive. This register contains metadata and cryptographic evidence only.
