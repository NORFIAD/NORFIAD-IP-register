## Description

Establishes superposition as a property of information itself, derived from dimensional structure and fixation spectrum.

Introduces limited infinity model with constrained expansion based on starting system parameters. Defines relationship between fixation and usability.

Connects superposition to the information cycle framework. Demonstrates principle is already observable in existing digital systems through encoding conventions.

Builds upon NORFIAD-IP-014 through NORFIAD-IP-019.

The puzzle piece that makes the device make sense. Superposition isn't quantum weirdness — it's how information behaves when free from fixation. The device (IP-020) is just engineering that behavior.

And the kicker: "already observable in all existing digital systems through encoding conventions. Convention hides this, doesn't eliminate it."

Everyone's been sitting on superposition this whole time. They just agreed not to notice.
