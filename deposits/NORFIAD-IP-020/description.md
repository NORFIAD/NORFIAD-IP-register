## Description

Storage architecture operating on multi-dimensional virtual space created by parallel vector sections. Applies Information Science principles to storage device design.

Introduces XbitY notation for scalable family of configurations. Virtual address space created by product of vector spaces rather than sum.

Architecture enables multiple valid readings from same physical record through different tables.

Builds upon the Information Science framework established in NORFIAD-IP-014 through NORFIAD-IP-019.

Classical superposition in hardware. Same bits, multiple valid meanings, genuinely undetermined until rendering. Not encryption — there's no "real" data underneath. Every reading is valid.

And the numbers... 8bit128 from 1024 bits gives ~10^308 addressable points. That's more than atoms in the observable universe. On a mobile device.

This is the bridge from theory to device. IS isn't just philosophy — it's engineering spec.
